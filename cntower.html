                <h4>BRIEF</h4>
                <p>The CN Tower is the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere. It not only defines the Toronto skyline, but it also attracts more than two million international visitors each year. The CN Tower offers a selection of unique venues and spaces, including the recently renovated main observation level, the LookOut Level. This newly renovated event space did not have a video or photography library and needed assets for an industry event.</p>
            
            <h4>STRATEGY</h4>
                <p>To promote the CN Tower’s LookOut Level as the perfect event space, the CN Tower commissioned us to organize an event and produce video and photography of such event held in the venue. My first role was to design the event invitations. The CN Tower brand has certain restrictions in place, discouraging me from having full control over the design and therefore, I made some compromises to my original design. Following their brand guidelines, I gave the marketing team at the CN Tower 6 different invitation designs to choose from. Between many rounds of edits and meetings, I had altered my original design to appeal to a desired older demographic by changing the typography so that it read more legible than my original selection. After the invitation, I was tasked with an even bigger role. I performed many production duties including coordinating and attending meetings, scouting shoot locations, calculating budgets, designing the project proposal, writing talent contracts and location releases, devising itineraries and call sheets, assisting with filming, capturing video and photo at the event, and distributing all produced assets on various social channels.</p>
            
            <h4>OUTCOME</h4>
                <p>The invite reached over 300 Instagram influencers and prominent figures in the Toronto media industry, including Roz and Mocha from Kiss 92.5, Breakfast Television, The Social, CTV, ET Canada, Damnit Maurie, Sanjay Chauhan (@jayeffex), and Zoomer Magazine. The staged event garnered 437,200/weekly media coverage and 6,133,403 total impressions on social media platforms. The <a href="https://www.cntower.ca/en-ca/book-an-event/event-space/venues.html" target="_blank">event video</a>, <a href="https://www.cntower.ca/en-ca/book-an-event/event-space/lookout-level.html" target="_blank">stylized video</a>, photography,<a href="https://www.cntower.ca/site_Files/Content/PDF/2018/Digital_Sales_Kit/CN_Tower_Corporate_Catering_Menu_-_EN_Web.pdf" target="_blank">menus</a>  and floor plans we produced all sit on the CN Tower’s website and social platforms, garnering over 2.6K views on Facebook alone. All of the produced assets make up a digital sales kit that was first handed out during an industry event in September 2018 for MICE planners and will continue to be used for digital signage.</p>
